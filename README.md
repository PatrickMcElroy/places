# places

An IOS app built to help users keep track of their commonly visited locations and statistics about them.

Merry Christmas Chris! You asked for app ideas, so here's a big one I've been thinking about and designing that I'd love to work on with you.

I've done some research on the more location specific parts of this, and I can't wait to build it out, re-design what we can, and learn more from the best app maker I know.

Testing work on locations done in places-testing. The places folder is a fresh IOS App Xcode workspace.
Design work done here: https://www.figma.com/file/fWXmMNUkrSa3Za7ZATrsNc/Places-App?node-id=0%3A1&t=NgunUeNitzvV87xH-0, can work off of, change, or throw out altogether, just an example of the functionality :)
